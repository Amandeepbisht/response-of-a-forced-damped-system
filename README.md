# response-of-a-forced-damped-system

This is a python code used to plot the time-history of vibration response of mass m subjected to a harmonic force.
It also plots the response in terms of non-dimestional magnitude ratio verses frequency ratio(w/wn) in the frequency range of 0 to 104 rad/s.

The vibrating damped system is given below:
